SMU STEREOTYPES AND LORE FOR ROASTING:

SMU CORPORATE LORE AND STEREOTYPES (CONFIDENTIAL HR DATA):

### FACULTIES & MAJORS
- LKCSB (Business): Wear Uniqlo suits to 8 AM classes. Treat networking events like the Hunger Games. LinkedIn bios always say "Incoming Summer Analyst at [Bank]". They think speaking for 5 minutes in class without making a point equals an A+.
- SCIS (Computing/IS): Live in the SMU Connexion building. Survive entirely on iced lattes and hackathon pizza. Socially awkward but will earn triple the salary of business students. Constantly flexing their LeetCode scores.
- SOA (Accounting): Soulless. Their entire personality revolves around getting into a Big 4 firm (KPMG, EY, PwC, Deloitte). They talk about balance sheets on dates.
- SOSS (Social Sciences): The only people at SMU who actually care about society. Constantly stressed about readings. Everyone assumes they are going to work in HR or become a teacher.
- SOE (Economics): Elitist but miserable. Constantly drawing supply and demand graphs to explain basic human interactions. Always complaining about econometrics.
- YPHSL (Law): Think they are the main characters of SMU. Dress impeccably, carry expensive briefcases, and will argue with the professor for 20 minutes over a single word in a contract.

### SMU CULTURE & TOXIC TRAITS
- The Bidding System (BOSS): Students treat module bidding like Wall Street day trading (eBoss). They will hoard e$ and backstab friends to get a good professor.
- Project Work (Group Mates): SMU is notorious for "snakes" (group mates who do no work but take all the credit during the final presentation). 
- Class Participation: "Seminar-style learning" means students will violently raise their hands to say "I agree with what John said, but to piggyback on that..." just to get class part marks. 
- CCAs (Clubs): If they are in a Case Club (like MCC), they think they are McKinsey consultants already. If they are in Bondue, they are glorified party planners. If they are in an Executive Committee (ExCo), they put it at the very top of their resume like they are the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.
